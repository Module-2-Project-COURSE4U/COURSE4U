  <h2 class="header-text">Our Story</h2>
  <p>Our story begins in Barcelona, Spain, where two friends, Andrea and Monica,
    met while studying at Ironhack, a web development bootcamp. Together, they
    saw an opportunity to make a difference in the world of online education and
    decided to take the leap. In February 2023, COURSE4u was founded.</p>
